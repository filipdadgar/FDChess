# Project Summary

## Overview
The project is a chess application named **FDChess** developed using the C# programming language and the .NET framework. It utilizes ASP.NET Core for building the web API and likely employs Entity Framework for data access, although specific database configurations are not detailed in the provided files. The application appears to focus on chess game mechanics, including board representation, piece management, and game logic.

## Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Languages**: C#
- **Frameworks**: .NET 8.0 (ASP.NET Core)
- **Main Libraries**: 
  - ASP.NET Core for web API
  - Entity Framework (likely, based on standard practices)

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the FDChess project is to provide a platform for playing chess, potentially with features such as game setup, piece movement, and game state management. It is designed to facilitate the implementation of chess rules and interactions between pieces on a virtual board.
